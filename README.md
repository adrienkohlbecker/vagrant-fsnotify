vagrant-fsnotify
================

Forward filesystem change notifications to your [Vagrant][vagrant] VM.

Problem
-------

Some filesystems (e.g. ext4, HFS+) have a feature of event notification.
Interested applications can subscribe and are notified when filesystem events
happen (e.g. a file was created, modified or deleted).

Applications can make use of this system to provide features such as auto-reload
or live updates. For example, [Jekyll][jekyll] regenerates the static website
and [Guard][guard] triggers a test run or a build when source files are
modified.

Unfortunately, [Vagrant][vagrant] users have a hard time making use of these
features when the application is running inside a virtual machine. When the file
is modified on the host, the event is not propagated to the guest and the
auto-reload never happens.

There are several bug reports related to this issue:

- <https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/10660>
- <https://github.com/guard/listen/issues/53>
- <https://github.com/guard/listen/issues/57>
- <https://github.com/guard/guard/issues/269>
- <https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/707>

There are two generally accepted solutions. The first is fall back to long
polling, the other is to
[forward the events over TCP][forwarding-file-events-over-tcp]. The problem with
long polling is that it's painfully slow, especially in shared folders. The
problem with forwarding events is that it's not a general approach that works
for any application.

Solution
--------

`vagrant-fsnotify` proposes a different solution: run a process listening for
filesystem events on the host and, when a notification is received, access the
virtual machine guest and `touch` the file in there (or `touch` followed by a
`rm` in case of file removals), causing an event to be propagated on the guest
filesystem.

This leverages the speed of using real filesystem events while still being
general enough to don't require any support from applications.

Caveats
-------

Due to the nature of filesystem events and the fact that `vagrant-fsnotify` uses
`touch`, the events are triggerred back on the host a second time.  To avoid
infinite loops, we add an arbitrary debounce of 2 seconds between `touch`-ing
the same file. Thus, if a file is modified on the host more than once in 2
seconds the VM will only see one notification.  If the second trigger on the
host or this arbitrary debounce is unacceptable for your application,
`vagrant-fsnotify` might not be for you.

Installation
------------

`vagrant-fsnotify` is a [Vagrant][vagrant] plugin and can be installed by
running:

```console
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-fsnotify
```

[Vagrant][vagrant] version 1.7.3 or greater is required.

Usage
-----

### Basic setup

In `Vagrantfile` synced folder configuration, add the `fsnotify: true`
option. For example, in order to enable `vagrant-fsnotify` for the the default
`/vagrant` shared folder, add the following:

```ruby
config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/vagrant", fsnotify: true
```

When the guest virtual machine is up, run the following:

```console
$ vagrant fsnotify
```

This starts the long running process that captures filesystem events on the host
and forwards them to the guest virtual machine.

### Run automatically on vagrant up

To have `vagrant fsnotify` start automatically with your guest, you can use triggers. Add this to your `Vagrantfile`:

```ruby
  config.trigger.after :up do |t|
    t.name = "vagrant-fsnotify"
    t.run = { inline: "vagrant fsnotify" }
  end
```

Now, whenever you run `vagrant up`, `vagrant fsnotify` will be run as well. Learn more at https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/triggers/

### Multi-VM environments

In multi-VM environments, you can specify the name of the VMs targeted by
`vagrant-fsnotify` using:

```console
$ vagrant fsnotify <vm-name-1> <vm-name-2> ...
```

### Excluding files

To exclude files or directories from being watched, you can add an `:exclude`
option, which takes an array of strings (matched as a regexp against relative
paths):

```ruby
config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/vagrant", fsnotify: true,
                                         exclude: ["path1", "some/directory"]
```

This will exclude all files inside the `path1` and `some/directory`. It will
also exclude files such as `another/directory/path1`

### Guest path override

If your actual path on the VM is not the same as the one in `synced_folder`, for
example when using [`vagrant-bindfs`][vagrant-bindfs], you can use the
`:override_guestpath` option:

```ruby
config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/vagrant", fsnotify: true,
                                         override_guestpath: "/real/path"
```

This will forward a notification on `./myfile` to `/real/path/myfile` instead of
`/vagrant/myfile`.

### Select filesystem events

By default, when the `:fsnotify` key in the `Vagrantfile` is configured with
`true`, all filesystem events are forwarded to the VM (i.e. file creation,
modification and removal events). If, instead, you want to select only a few of
those events to be forwarded (e.g. you don't care about file removals), you can
use an Array of Symbols among the following options: `:added`, `:modified` and
`:removed`.

For example, to forward only added files events to the default `/vagrant`
folder, add the following to the `Vagrantfile`:

```ruby
config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/vagrant", fsnotify: [:added]
```

### Set touch flags

By default, the touch command on the VM will be run with modification flag and access flag, setting
both modification and access attributes of the file. If only either flag should be used the `:touch`
param can be set per machine config in the `Vagrantfile`. The param supports an array with either or both 
`:modification` and `:access` values. 

As example, to only set the access attribute of files when they have changed on the host system set the following
in the `Vagrantfile`:

```ruby
config.fsnotify.touch = [:access]
```
or for instances and providers
```ruby
config.vm.define "vm" do |instance|
    instance.fsnotify.touch = [:access]
end
```

Development
-------------

To hack on `vagrant-fsnotify`, you need a recent ruby and virtualbox installed.

Then, after cloning the repo:
```shell
# install development gems
bundle install

# run vagrant commands by prefixing them with `bundle exec` to run with the plugin installed from source
# this will launch a basic ubuntu VM and monitor file changes on the current directory
bundle exec vagrant up

# make changes to the code
vim lib/vagrant-fsnotify/command-fsnotify.rb
...

# relaunch the process to activate your changes
bundle exec vagrant fsnotify
```

Original work
-------------

This plugin used [`vagrant-rsync-back`][vagrant-rsync-back] by @smerill and the
[Vagrant][vagrant] source code as a starting point.
